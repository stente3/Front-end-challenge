## About The Project

![alt text](https://github.com/stente3/Front-end-challenge/blob/main/designs/main.png)

This is a challenge taken from the "Frontend Mentor" website, it was done with the aim of consolidating my front-end skills with the Bootstrap framework.
In this exercise it was decided to use the PurgeCSS tool, which is used to eliminate unused CSS code and thereby improve the performance of the web page.
### Built With

* [HTML5](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/HTML)
* [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/)
* [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/documentation)
* [Mobile frist](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps/Responsive/Mobile_first)
* [Responsive design](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Responsive_Design)
* [Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox)


## Getting Started
This is the structure of the folders.

The-project/ <br>
├──index.html <br>
├── designs/ <br>
├── sass/ <br>
├── images/ <br>
└── public/ <br>
......└──css/ <br>

The sass files that are inside the "base" folder are the general configuration of the project and the files that are inside the "layout" folder are the ones that directly affect the client-side layout.

### Prerequisites

* You need a web browser to view the content, it is recommended NOT to use Internet Explorer
* A code editor to modify the content
* Git to clone the repository
* The "Live Sass Compiler" visual studio code extension or any other Sass compiler
* Internet connection if you plan to use the "PurgeCSS" tool

### Installation
1. Clone the repository in the terminal 
   ```sh
   https://github.com/stente3/Front-end-challenge.git
   ```

## Usage
To modify the whole project in general, you just have to modify the HTML, if you want to modify it in a more specific way you can do it in the custom.scss file that is in the sass folder and this file compiles it in the custom.css file that is found inside the css folder.
Finally, use the purgeCSS tool to improve application performance by removing unnecessary CSS code, call the generated file "reduce.css" and replace it with the one that already exists.
